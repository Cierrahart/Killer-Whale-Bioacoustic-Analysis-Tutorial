# Part 1: Decompressing Files

### Objective
To decompress X3 format WAV files for further processing and analysis.

### Description 
This section guides you through the process of decompressing compressed WAV files using the X3 Converter tool. It's a crucial step for users who have their audio data in a compressed format. Proper decompression is essential for subsequent data analysis in PAMGuard and Raven Pro. If your files are decompressed, skip to [Part 2](./2-FileOrganizing.md).
